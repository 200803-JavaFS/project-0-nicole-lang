This is a personal reference for what each user type should be able to do.

A Customer IS A User
Customers have View and Update permissions but only for their own accounts.
	
An Employee IS A User; 1 Employee HAS Many Customers
	
An employee can view the information of any customer but cannot edit it
They also can approve/deny account creation requests.
	
Permissions for Employee users: View, Update(only to change default user into customer), 
Delete(only if deleting an unregistered User)

An Admin IS AN Employee
	
An admin can carry out all the same methods as a Customer or Employee, on all accounts
They also have the ability to cancel (delete) registered accounts, except for their own.
	
Admin users have View, Update, and Delete permissions for all accounts.
